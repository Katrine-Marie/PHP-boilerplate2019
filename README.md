# PHP-boilerplate2019
A PHP MVC framework - intended for use in my personal projects. 

Includes, beside the framework logic itself, 
* a complete login system, and
* a Gulp setup for SASS compilation, as well as concatenation and minification of JS files.

## How to Use

### MVC framework

The `/public` directory contains the assets used for the project, such as CSS and JS files, and images. The CSS and JS in this directory can be generated by the Gulp workflow, if you wish to use that.

The `/app` directory is where all the MVC logic goes.

You edit the `/app/config/config.php` file, to use your own database authentication, site name and URL root.



### Gulp setup

The `/source` directory is where you will find some base styling in `.scss` files, to get started with. It is also where you can place your JS files, if you wish to have ES6+ code compiled by Babel, and/or minified and bundled.

You use the `gulp watch` command, in order to automatically run the above mentioned tasks upon file changes in `*.scss` or `*.js` files the `/source` directory.

NOTE: This setup still uses Gulp 3.9.1 - update to version 4 pending.
